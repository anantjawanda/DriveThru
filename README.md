# DriveThru
Covid-19 Drive Thru Code

Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from hearing about the problems that our team heard about when it came to drive throughs during the COVID19 outbreak. We wanted to create an application that solves the problems of shortages and reducing the amount of contact between patients and workers of the drivethrough.

What it does
Our app allows patients to upload basic information to their accounts, creating a digital record. With this digital record, the process of drive-through coronavirus testing can focus less on the hassle of paperwork and more on the actual test.

How we built it
We built a website using HTML/CSS/JS. We integrated parts of Google Forms and a QR code library to the code. We create a Python backend using Flask, but to host it on GitHub Pages, we converted it to use only HTML.

Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into during the process were trying to upload our data into a MySQL database or MongoDB database as well getting some of our buttons and links to work. We also could not deploy our Python backend code.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of developing and deploying a website that has some of our desired functions working with the limited experience among our group with half attending their first hackthon and half attending their second.

What we learned
We learned how to create a website, use Google resources, and code a project in HTML and Python.

What's next for DriveThruCovid-19
We hope to fix any issues that occurred for us during the process and also features that allow for the information from users to be stored in databases and be readily accessible.
